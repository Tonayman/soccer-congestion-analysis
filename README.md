# Soccer Match Congestion & Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project studies how Schedule Congestions from Match Days or periods and Rest Time between matches have affected teams' performances in international Soccer Competitions (UEFA European Championship and Nations League) through some historical match data and will correlate Rest Days, Matches Played, and Competitive Outcomes.

## Data Source
- UEFA EURO Matches (1960 - 2024)
- UEFA Nations League Matches (2019 - 2025)
- The dataset will include the Match Dates, Teams, Scores, and Competition Metadata.

## Key Questions
- How often do teams play in International Tournaments?
- Does having a very short recovery time (i.e., Rest Days after Matches) result in poorer performance than teams with more time to recover between matches?
- How much does Schedule Congestion impact a team’s Points Earned and Goal Difference?

## Methods
- Cleaning and Restructuring Data into Team-Level Time-Series
- Feature Engineering
- Days Prior to Last Match
- How Many Matches were played in Rolling Time Windows
- Analysis of Data and Creating Visualisations

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results
- Teams achieved the highest average points with approximately 7–10 days of rest.
- Very short rest (0–2 days) was associated with worse performance.
- Goal difference showed higher variance, but followed a similar trend.
