# Soccer Match Congestion & Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes how match schedule congestion and rest periods impact team performance in major international soccer competitions (UEFA European Championship and Nations League).
Using historical match data, the project explores relationships between rest days, match frequency, and competitive outcomes.

## Data Source
- UEFA EURO match data (1960–2024)
- UEFA Nations League match data (2019–2025)
- Dataset includes match dates, teams, scores, and competition metadata

## Key Questions
- How frequently do teams play during international tournaments?
- Does shorter rest between matches correlate with worse performance?
- How does match congestion affect points earned and goal difference?

## Methods
- Data cleaning and restructuring into a team-level time series
- Feature engineering:
  - Days since last match
  - Matches played in rolling time windows
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Status
🚧 Project in progress — analysis and visualizations currently being developed.
